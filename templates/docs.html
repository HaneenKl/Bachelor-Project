    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This page is designed to allow the user to perform semigroup-related computations using either regular
            expressions or Arden expressions.
            The available operations include generating Egg-box diagrams, Cayley graphs, and checking equations based on
            the elements of the semigroup.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Input Types</h2>
        <p>Users can choose between two input modes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arden Expression</strong>: This is an input format used for expressing transitions in an
                automaton.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Regular Expression</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Arden Expression</h3>
        <p>
            In the Arden equation format, each equation defines a transition for a particular state in an automaton.
            Multiple equations can be entered, one per line.
            Each equation should consist of terms in the form of a symbol followed by a variable or terminal symbol. The
            terms of the equation are concatenated by the "+" symbol.
            <br>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
            <code> <br>
                A = aB + aA + ε<br>
                B = bB + cC + c<br>
                C = cA
            </code>
        </p>

        <h3>Regular Expression</h3>
        <p>
            The input for regular expressions supports the following operations:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concatenation</strong>: Characters next to each other are treated as concatenated terms (e.g.,
                "ab").
            </li>
            <li><strong>Union</strong>: Use the "+" symbol to represent union.</li>
            <li><strong>Kleene Star</strong>: Use "*" to represent the Kleene star operation.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to treat each entered character as a symbol, check the box below the input field. This will
            treat each individual character in the input as a separate symbol.
            For example, entering <code>ab*c</code> without the checkbox checked will treat "ab" and "c" as single
            characters. The generated language will be <code>{c, abc, ababc, …}</code>.
            <br>
            When the checkbox is checked, each letter will be treated individually as a symbol. So, entering
            <code>ab*c</code> with the checkbox checked will treat "a", "b", and "c" as separate symbols.
            The generated language will then be <code>{ac, abc, abbc, …}</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Operations</h2>
        <p>After selecting a mode and entering the input, the following computations are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Egg-box Diagram</strong>: Generates the Egg-box diagram for the input expression.</li>
            <li><strong>Left Cayley Graph</strong>: Generates the left Cayley graph for the input expression.</li>
            <li><strong>Right Cayley Graph</strong>: Generates the right Cayley graph for the input expression.</li>
            <li><strong>Equation Check</strong>: Allows checking whether multiple equations hold based on the semigroup
                elements.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Equation Check</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Equation Check</strong> section allows users to input multiple equations. Each equation should
            be entered on a new line.
        </p>
        <p>
            The input can include exponentiation or omega expressions such as <code>(x y)^w = z^3 x</code>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <pre>
x^3 y = z^w
y^2 z = x
z x = x y^2
(x y)^3 = z^2
z^4 = (y^2 z^3 x)^w
</pre>
        <p>
            Symbols must be separated by spaces in order to be seen as single symbols.
        </p>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            A history panel is available to track the inputs that have been entered. This allows users to see previous
            modes and inputs.
            Users can also clear the history if needed.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This page provides an interface to work with semigroup computations. Whether you're working with
            regular expressions or Arden equations,
            you can easily generate graphical representations or check the validity of equations.
